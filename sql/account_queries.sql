-- MAGIC ### Account Admin Permission Changes
-- MAGIC Databricks account admin users should be limited to few trusted personas responsible for managing your Databricks account. The granting of new admin privileges should be reviewed.

-- MAGIC ### Repeated Failed Login Attempts
-- MAGIC Customers are encouraged to leverage their SSO capability and disable local password usage for all users except the account owner. In the event local passwords are still used, this detection helps monitor for any possible brute force attacks to login to the workspace. In the example below, it buckets repeated login attempts in a 30 minute window.

-- COMMAND ----------

SELECT
  WINDOW(timestamp, '30 minutes'),
  requestParams.user,
  statusCode,
  count(*) AS total

  audit_logs.gold_account_accounts

-- MAGIC ###Detect changes to Production workspaces
-- MAGIC Databricks account administrators can [Create and manage workspaces using the account console](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings-e2/workspaces.html). However, for specific resources (I.e. production workspaces) you may want to be proactively informed if they have been updated or deleted. 
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC The following query can be used to monitor changes to Databricks workspaces which have ```prod``` in their ```workspace_name```

-- COMMAND ----------

SELECT
  timestamp,
  email,
  actionName,
  requestParams.workspace_id AS workspace_id,
  requestParams,

-- MAGIC ###Most Popular Data Assets
-- MAGIC [Unity Catalog](https://databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) makes it easy to discover, audit and govern data assets in one place. Having a unified governance layer allows us to perform analytics on our data products. So we can (for example) run a query to see what our most popular datasets are.

-- MAGIC This query could be taken a step further, by joining the `source_ip` to geolocation datasets such as those [offered for free by MaxMind](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data). Using the function below we can join our `sourceIpAddress` to the integer ranges used by the geolocation data, and get a rough location for our delta sharing requests. You'll need to use the [geoip2-csv-converter](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip2-csv-converter) to generate the start and end range values, and then upload them to Databricks SQL to match the join paths below.
